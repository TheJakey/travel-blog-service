# Travel blog - Backend for a [mobile app using React Native](https://github.com/ViktoriaFekete/travel-blog-react-native-client)

This repository contains the CRUD operations for our travel application. 

The project was built with the purpose of learning React Native and getting into the development of mobile applications. Backend was a mandatory part that didn't get much attention. Please, consider this fact before reading/using any part of it :)
